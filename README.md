## 📊 Project Overview

This dashboard provides an intuitive, map-based view of **cancer-related events per 100,000 people**, adjusted for age and standardized to the U.S. population. It highlights:

- **Total cancer events index by U.S. state** (color-graded heatmap)
- **Breakdown by major age groups and gender**
- **Infant mortality and incidence comparisons**
- **Population-level insights on cancer trends**

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- 🗺 **Interactive U.S. Choropleth Map**  
  Visualizes cancer events by state using a custom color scale (Below 5K to Above 60K cancer events)

- 👥 **Demographic Breakdown**  
  Highlights the **age group 70–74** as the most impacted by both incidence and mortality.

- 📉 **Gender Distribution**  
  Side-by-side comparison of **male vs. female** incidence and mortality rates.

- 📌 **Infant Analysis**  
  Captures early-life impact of cancer (<1 year), an often-overlooked segment.

---

## 💡 Insights Delivered

- States like **California, Texas, and New York** show the **highest cancer burden**, with over 60,000 cancer-related events.
- Females show a slightly **higher mortality percentage (52.13%)** than males (47.87%) in both age extremes (infants and elderly).
- Age group **70–74 years** has the highest share of both incidents and deaths, emphasizing the need for targeted care programs for the elderly.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI / Tableau** (or similar BI tools) for dashboard creation  
- Public cancer datasets (SEER, CDC, etc.)  
- Custom color gradients and slicers for interactivity  
- CSV/Excel for pre-processing

## 📈 Potential Extensions

- Add filtering by **cancer type** (e.g., breast, lung, prostate)  
- Include **time series trends** to show change over years  
- Enable **drill-down to county-level data**  
- Integrate **socioeconomic or racial disparity filters**
